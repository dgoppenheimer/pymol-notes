# Molecular Modeling Tutorials

The tutorials are from the [Cloud-based Tutorials on Structural Bioinformatics](https://github.com/pb3lab/ibm3202) Github repository. These tutorials use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) Jupyter notebooks. Be sure to switch to the correct Google account after starting Colab, but before you save the notebook to your Google Drive.
