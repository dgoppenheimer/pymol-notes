# Welcome to PyMOL Notes

Mainly, I built this site to keep track of my notes when using PyMOL. Hopefully I'll be able to find what I need, when I need it.

But I also wanted to make a website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I previously built a blog, [Cell Bones](https://dgoppenheimer.github.io/oppenheimer-blog/), using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). When I found the Hugo theme, [Learn](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-learn/en/), I thought it would be ideal to sort out all my PyMOL notes.
