VMD scripting is handy for executing command that you do often--like preparing a molecule for a figure, or for carrying out certain analyses. When I use PyMOL, I have a set of scripts for coloring atoms and defining various representations so I don't have to repeat these by hand each time I need them. In addition, there are useful scripts available for analyzing protein structure and trajectories.

## Scripting Resources
