VMD scripting is handy for executing command that you do often--like preparing a molecule for a figure, or for carrying out certain analyses. When I use PyMOL, I have a set of scripts for coloring atoms and defining various representations so I don't have to repeat these by hand each time I need them. In addition, there are useful scripts available for analyzing protein structure and trajectories.

## Scripting Resources

Here are some web resources for scripting in VMD:

From the VMD wiki:  
[Scripting in VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/vmd/tutorial-html/node4.html)  
[Advanced Script Writing](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/vmd-1.3/ug/node246.html) 

Other VMD scripting resources:  
[VMD Script Library](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/script_library/)  
A few useful short scripts: [VMD](http://titin.abrol.csun.edu/abrollab/protocols/temp_docs/VMD.html)
