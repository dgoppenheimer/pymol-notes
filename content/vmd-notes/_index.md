# VMD Notes

In addition to PyMOL, I also use [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/). I like that VMD has [ambient occlusion lighting](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/minitutorials/tachyonao/), which greatly enhances the visual appearance of the molecules. In this chapter, I'll keep track of the various commands and scripts that I use most often.
