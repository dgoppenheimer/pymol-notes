[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/index.html) (or the newer interface, [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/index.html)) is a web-based notebook and programming environment. It can be used to store and run code, conduct analyses, and prepare visualizations. Notebooks can be shared and many programming languages are supported.
