I minimized the .svg file on the https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/ site.\nUpdate The .svg file was rather large and didn\u0026rsquo;t look right. I decided to try something different. I used the .png file from PyMOL as a template and created a series of tubes for the bonds and circles for the atoms. I used a 2 pt black stroke and filled the objects with white. It took a while to get the layers in the correct order so the appropriate bonds were on top of the appropriate atoms. I saved the file as a .svg file. Without the .png embedded as base64, the file was much smaller.\nRefer to this post on Best Practices for Working with SVGs for useful tips.\nDo not change the logo.html file in the pymol-notes/themes/hugo-theme-learn/layouts/partials/ directory. Instead make a new partial in the layouts/partials directory of your local project. This partial will have the priority.\n Create a partials directory in the pymol-notes/layouts/ directory. Copy the logo.html file from pymol-notes/themes/hugo-theme-learn/layouts/partials/ to the pymol-notes/layouts/partials directory.\nOpen the new copy of logo.html in your favorite text editor and replace the svg code with your new logo.\nThe logo size will adapt to different screen sizes automatically.\n Replace the code in between the \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; tags in logo.html with the contents of your .svg file. Also add the following to the \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; tag:\nid=\u0026#34;pymol-notes-logo\u0026#34; style=\u0026#34;width:100%; height:100%;\u0026#34; To the second and third \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; tags, add fill=\u0026quot;#fff\u0026quot; so that the text is displayed as white.\nSave the logo.html file, and spin up the site with hugo server. Check the site locally at 127.0.0.1:1313/pymol-notes.\nSuccess!\nCreate a favicon Select the molecule image and paste it into a new Affinity Designer document.\nExport it as favicon.png at 64 x 52 px (144 dpi resolution).\nPlace it in the local static/images/ folder.\nSuccess!\n"

(See these instructions on the Hugo website.) GitHub provides native support for building Jekyll sites, but does not have native support for Hugo. Nonetheless, using GitHub Actions, I can build and deploy my Hugo site automatically when I push new content to the main branch of my GitHub repository.\nGetting started Rename master to main First, rename local branch.\ncd ~/Sites/pymol-notes git branch -m master main git status On branch main nothing to commit, working tree clean Next, rename remote branch.\ngit push -u origin main git push origin --delete master Because I am the solo developer on this project and I have a single local repository, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to do anything else.\nAutomate the build and deploy workflow First, create a .github/workflows/ directory in your project root.\nNext, create a gh-pages.yaml file in the .github/workflows/ directory that has the following contents.\nname: Build and Deploy on: push: branches: - main jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout main uses: actions/checkout@v1 with: submodules: true - name: Hugo Deploy GitHub Pages uses: benmatselby/hugo-deploy-gh-pages@master env: HUGO_VERSION: 0.75.0 TARGET_REPO: dgoppenheimer.github.io/pymol-notes/ TOKEN: ${{ secrets.EXAMPLE_TOKEN }} Let\u0026rsquo;s test this.\nhugo new introduction/test-page.md Results No joy.\nHere is a nice tutorial:\nHugo: Deploy Static Site using GitHub Actions\nAnd another set of instructions that uses a similar .yml file from peaceiris:\nDeploy Hugo project to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions\nI had success using the peaceiris actions\nHere is the gh-pages.yml file that I used:\nname: github pages on: push: branches: - main # Set a branch to deploy jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-18.04 steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Setup Hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;0.75.1\u0026#39; # extended: true - name: Build run: hugo - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.EXAMPLE_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public Note: I removed \u0026ndash;minify from run: hugo, otherwise, my svg logo was not visible.\nGreat. Now I can work on a page, save it and do the following to update the site:\ncd ~/Sites/pymol-notes git status git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;updated site, added a page, corrected typos\u0026#34; git push origin main "
