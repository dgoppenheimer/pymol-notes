I minimized the .svg file on the https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/ site.\nUpdate The .svg file was rather large and didn\u0026rsquo;t look right. I decided to try something different. I used the .png file from PyMOL as a template and created a series of tubes for the bonds and circles for the atoms. I used a 2 pt black stroke and filled the objects with white. It took a while to get the layers in the correct order so the appropriate bonds were on top of the appropriate atoms. I saved the file as a .svg file. Without the .png embedded as base64, the file was much smaller.\nRefer to this post on Best Practices for Working with SVGs for useful tips.\nDo not change the logo.html file in the pymol-notes/themes/hugo-theme-learn/layouts/partials/ directory. Instead make a new partial in the layouts/partials directory of your local project. This partial will have the priority.\n Create a partials directory in the pymol-notes/layouts/ directory. Copy the logo.html file from pymol-notes/themes/hugo-theme-learn/layouts/partials/ to the pymol-notes/layouts/partials directory.\nOpen the new copy of logo.html in your favorite text editor and replace the svg code with your new logo.\nThe logo size will adapt to different screen sizes automatically.\n Replace the code in between the \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; tags in logo.html with the contents of your .svg file. Also add the following to the \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; tag:\nid=\u0026#34;pymol-notes-logo\u0026#34; style=\u0026#34;width:100%; height:100%;\u0026#34; To the second and third \u0026lt;path\u0026gt; tags, add fill=\u0026quot;#fff\u0026quot; so that the text is displayed as white.\nSave the logo.html file, and spin up the site with hugo server. Check the site locally at 127.0.0.1:1313/pymol-notes.\nSuccess!\nCreate a favicon Select the molecule image and paste it into a new Affinity Designer document.\nExport it as favicon.png at 64 x 52 px (144 dpi resolution).\nPlace it in the local static/images/ folder.\nSuccess!\n"},{"uri":"https://dgoppenheimer.github.io/pymol-notes/","title":"PyMOL Notes","tags":[],"description":"","content":"  Welcome to PyMOL Notes Mainly, I built this site to keep track of my notes when using PyMOL.
